"""
Name: esri_file_to_dataframe.py
Purpose: Converts ESRI file (File GDB table, SHP, or feature class) to either pandas dataframe
    or geopandas geodataframe (if it is spatial data)

    NOTE - in the past geopandas has had a read_file method that enabled users to specify
        ESRI file gdb feature class, but it's been unreliable and subject to issues with version
        updates. This formula aims to use common ESRI and GeoPandas functions to maximize long-term reliability.
