GENERAL COMMENT
OSM PBF files contain ___ tables: lines, nodes, _____?.
You can extract individual tables to SHPs, or all tables to a SQLite DB that can be opened in ArcGIS as a database.

USING ESRI PYTHON ENVIRONMENTS
As of 2/14/2023, you will get a "missing DLL" error if trying to run OGR2OGR from a command line within an ESRI python environment.
To workaround this, create a fresh, non-ESRI conda environment and install gdal in it.

CONVERT OSM PBF TO SHP
ogr2ogr <destination SHP path> <source PBF path> <layer type, e.g. "lines", "points"> lines

CONVERT PBF TO SQLITE DB
ogr2ogr -f SQLite <destination .sqlite path> <source PBF path>
Example ogr2ogr -f SQLite "P:\Conveyal\ConveyalTrialGIS\SQLite\test_sqlite.sqlite" "P:\Conveyal\Networks\OSM\PBF\sacog20210907filtered.osm.pbf"
>>NOTE THAT THE RESULTING TABLES ARE NOT READILY MAPPABLE IN ARCGIS

MAKE PBF FROM SHP(s)
***Not doable with ogr2ogr
